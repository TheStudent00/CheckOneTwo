PURPOSE
This License grants broad rights to use the Work while denying those rights to entities and uses that harm vulnerable beings or the biosphere.

DEFINITIONS
“Work” means the mathematical or computational work, including text, proofs, data, datasets, schemata, specifications, algorithms, models, source code, trained or untrained model parameters (“weights”), prompts, configuration files, documentation, and associated materials released under this License.
“Contributor” means any copyright holder that publishes the Work or submits a Contribution.
“Contribution” means any change or addition intentionally submitted to the Work by a Contributor.
“Entity” means any individual or legal person, including parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and contractors acting on its behalf.
“Prohibited Use” and “Prohibited Entity” are defined in §4.
“Designated Harmful Regime (DHR)” means a state apparatus or occupying authority historically or currently responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, or aggressive war, as recognized by widely accepted international law sources (e.g., the Nuremberg Principles, Rome Statute) or by authoritative tribunals; this explicitly includes the National Socialist regime in Germany (1933–1945). “Agent of a DHR” includes ministries, state-owned firms, and front organizations acting on behalf of a DHR.

1. COPYRIGHT & PATENT LICENSE
Subject to §2–§7, each Contributor grants any Entity that is not a Prohibited Entity a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable (except as stated in §6) copyright license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work.

Subject to §2–§7, each Contributor also grants a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable (except as stated in §6) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work and Contributions, covering patent claims licensable by that Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or in combination with the Work.

2. NOTICE
The copyright notice and this License must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.

3. CONTRIBUTIONS (INBOUND = OUTBOUND)
Unless stated otherwise in writing, any Contribution intentionally submitted to the Work by a Contributor is licensed under this License.

4. ETHICAL BOUNDARIES (SCOPE OF LICENSE)
The licenses in §1 are granted only for uses that are not Prohibited Uses and only to Entities that are not Prohibited Entities.

4.1 Prohibited Uses (non-exhaustive):
  (a) Development, operation, or maintenance of fossil-fuel extraction, production, or refining (coal, crude oil, tar/bitumen, natural gas). Personal consumer use of energy/fuel is not prohibited.
  (b) Design, deployment, or operation of systems intended for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or violations of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions; or for targeted mass repression (e.g., mass surveillance to persecute protected groups).
  (c) Weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, chemical) or delivery systems primarily designed for such.
  (d) Deliberate large-scale environmental destruction, including activities reasonably expected to accelerate climate catastrophe (e.g., new thermal coal developments).
  (e) Training, tuning, or operating models to generate or direct the above.

4.2 Prohibited Entities:
  (a) DHRs and their Agents.
  (b) Entities whose primary business (≥50% consolidated revenue) is fossil-fuel extraction/production/refining.
  (c) Entities finally adjudicated within the last 5 years by an internationally recognized court/tribunal for war crimes, systemic human-rights violations, or systemic gender discrimination.
  (d) Entities identified within the last 5 years by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in public reports/statements as responsible for war crimes or systemic human-rights violations.

4.3 Safe-Harbor Exceptions:
  Research, journalism, documentation, accountability, whistleblowing, or harm-reduction efforts reasonably aimed at preventing, exposing, or mitigating the harms listed in §4 remain permitted for otherwise non-Prohibited Entities.

5. DUE DILIGENCE & DOWNSTREAM
Licensees must take reasonable, good-faith steps to avoid knowingly providing the Work to Prohibited Entities or for Prohibited Uses. Redistribution must include this License in full. No sublicense or contract may circumvent §4. If a Licensee learns of a violation downstream, it must cease further provision and, where practicable, notify the Contributor(s).

6. TERMINATION, CURE, & PATENT RETALIATION
6.1 Automatic Termination: This License terminates automatically for any Entity that:
  (i) is or becomes a Prohibited Entity; or
  (ii) engages in a Prohibited Use; or
  (iii) violates §2 or §5 and fails to cure within 30 days after becoming aware; or
  (iv) asserts or threatens a patent claim in litigation (including counterclaims/cross-claims) alleging that the Work or a Contribution infringes a patent (“Patent Assertion”).
6.2 Reinstatement: For §6.1(iii), the license reinstates automatically upon cure within 30 days. For §6.1(iv), reinstatement requires written consent from all affected Contributors.
6.3 Reservation of Rights: Termination does not limit any other rights or remedies, including injunctive relief and damages.

7. TRADEMARKS
No trademark rights are granted, except as necessary for descriptive use.

8. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR ITS USE.

10. SEVERABILITY; NON-WAIVER; ANTI-AVOIDANCE
If any provision is unenforceable in a jurisdiction, it shall be modified only as needed to become enforceable while preserving intent; the remainder stays effective. Failure to enforce is not a waiver. Any attempt to relicense, proxy, or structure transactions to evade §4 is void.

11. INTERPRETATION
“Reasonable, good-faith steps” in §5 means diligence proportional to the scale and risk of distribution. Examples include sanctions/ownership checks, supplier codes, and contractual pass-through. Ambiguities are to be resolved to effectuate the Purpose.
