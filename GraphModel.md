# Project HQ Context: Graph Learning Sparse Init

## Purpose
This document contextualizes the code file **Graph Learning Sparse Init** within the larger objectives of Project HQ. The file represents exploratory and preliminary work on recursive graph structures for dynamic system modeling.

## Scope of Work
- **Abstractions Introduced**:
  - **Node**: Base element with state memory, update frequency, and learnable state functions.
  - **Edge**: Connects nodes with temporal weighting, enabling message passing across history slices.
  - **GraphModule**: Recursive container capable of representing both atomic nodes and higher-level clusters. Provides optimization and hierarchical delegation.
  - **Graph**: Collection of GraphModules handling step-wise state evolution.
  - **SuperGraph**: Meta-level orchestrator responsible for hierarchy management and optimization across modules.

- **Key Concepts Tested**:
  - Sparse temporal weights for efficient message passing.
  - Update frequencies (probabilistic node activation per step).
  - Hierarchical recursion via GraphModules.
  - Separation of optimization responsibilities between levels.

## Alignment with Project HQ Objectives
The work contributes to Project HQ’s goal of creating a **graph-based canonical framework** by:
- Demonstrating how atomic units (nodes + edges) scale into recursive structures.
- Exploring minimal yet extensible designs for optimization delegation.
- Establishing a foundation for meta-learning strategies at the SuperGraph level.
- Providing a starting point for investigating error propagation, convergence regions, and sparse computation efficiency.

## Current Status
- Focus is **exploration and preliminary versions**.
- Design favors flexibility over performance at this stage.
- Optimization methods are placeholders, intended for future development.

## Next Directions
- Implement SubGraph-to-SuperGraph error feedback mechanisms.
- Formalize optimization routines for update frequencies and temporal weights.
- Test convergence behaviors on known differential equation datasets.
- Explore learnable clustering at the SuperGraph level.

## Canvas Document Contents (Verbatim)

### 1. Stochastic World Models

### Universal Approximation and Randomness

* **UAT (Universal Approximation Theorem):** Guarantees that multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) approximate any continuous *deterministic* function. It does not cover stochastic/probabilistic mappings.
* **Deterministic NN limitation:** For noisy/stochastic data, a plain NN tends to approximate the conditional expectation \\( E\[y|x] \\), collapsing randomness into averages.

### Randomness as a Learnable Feature

* **What’s learnable:** Probability *laws* (distributions), not true randomness itself.
* **Requirements:**

  * Architectures or objectives that represent distributions (e.g., VAEs, normalizing flows, diffusion models, Bayesian NNs).
  * Losses like NLL or KL divergence instead of plain MSE.
* **Without explicit probabilistic design:** Pure MLPs cannot sample from distributions; they only regress toward means.

### Biological Neural Networks and Stochasticity

* **Evidence for randomness in the substrate:**

  * Neuronal firing is probabilistic due to ion channel noise.
  * Synaptic release is stochastic.
  * Exploration behaviors exploit randomness.
* **Functional role:**

  * Enables exploration (avoiding brittle determinism).
  * Encodes uncertainty via population coding.
  * Supports Bayesian-like inference naturally.
* **Conclusion:** Brains exploit stochasticity as a structural feature, not as “mere noise.”

### World Models and Recursion

* **Definition:** A world model transforms sensory input into an internal state, simulates possible futures, and compares predictions against reality.
* **Self-reference:** Required to use its own predictions to refine itself. Modeled as recursive updates of the internal state.
* **Bounded recursion:** Biological and artificial systems truncate horizons to avoid infinite regress.
* **Causal/statistical reasoning:** Emerges from the ability to simulate counterfactuals and futures internally.

### UAT Extensions for Probability

* **Distributional UATs:**

  * Neural networks can approximate probability distributions under metrics like Wasserstein or KL.
  * Examples: pushforward measures (Lu & Lu, 2020), probabilistic transformers, Gaussian mixture models.
* **Key requirement:** Access to randomness and distributional objectives.
* **Without noise input:** No universal approximation of stochastic processes is possible.

### Architectural Considerations

* **Plain MLP:** Approximates deterministic functions only.
* **Stochastic MLP:** Requires latent noise inputs to represent both deterministic and stochastic mappings.
* **Hierarchy & recursion:** Provide structure and abstraction but do not alone enable probabilistic modeling without randomness access.
* **Minimal additions:** Neutral noise input + distributional loss → universal approximation over deterministic and stochastic functions.

### Memory and Curation for Stochastic Comprehension

* **Key limitation without memory:** Identical inputs with multiple possible outputs collapse to averages.
* **With memory + curation:**

  * Store multiple outcomes for the same input.
  * Organize them into distributions.
  * Enables modeling of probabilistic branching.
* **Branching graphs:** Higher-level transformations can represent distributions as probabilistic transitions rather than deterministic functions.

### Big Picture

1. Deterministic UAT covers continuous functions only.
2. Distributional UATs exist, but require randomness in the architecture or input.
3. Biological brains embed randomness structurally, enabling probabilistic inference.
4. World models demand recursive, bounded self-reference to simulate futures.
5. Memory + curation allow comprehension of stochasticness even without internal randomness generation.
6. External randomness APIs (NumPy, hardware RNGs, quantum sources) suffice for sampling; the system just needs to understand how to use them.

**Conclusion:** Comprehension of stochasticness is achievable if the system can (a) store multiple outcomes, (b) curate them into distributions, and (c) leverage randomness from external or internal sources for simulation. This upgrades deterministic approximation into probabilistic world modeling.

---

## 2. Current Conversation State (Verbatim)

* **Topic:** Whether universal approximators without explicit probabilistic design can comprehend or model stochasticness.
* **Points Raised:**

  * Deterministic UAT does not extend to stochastic mappings.
  * Comprehension of stochasticness may arise if the system can accumulate and curate multiple outcomes for identical inputs.
  * Hierarchical graph/world-model architectures may scaffold stochastic comprehension, but collapse to deterministic approximations if randomness is absent.
  * Memory + curation mechanisms are enough to infer distributions without internal randomness generation.
* **Consensus:** Modeling stochastic processes requires either embedded randomness or storage/curation mechanisms capable of organizing outcomes into probabilistic structures. Randomness can be provided externally; comprehension of stochasticness is an internal representational achievement.

## Canvas: Graph Model – Overall Structure (v0.1)

# GraphModel – Overall Structure (v0.1)

## High-Level Concepts

* **Initial hierarchy bounds.** With minimal cluster size of 2 per level, the maximum number of levels L for `n_level_0_cores` is:

  $L_{max} = \left\lceil \log_2(\, n_{\text{level0 cores}}\,) \right\rceil$

* **Nascent modules.** After initial optimization, instantiate **nascent\_sub\_module** (identity structure with sparse learning) and optionally **nascent\_sup\_module**. These act as scaffold modules that can be specialized incrementally.

* **Persistent gradient structure.** Keep an always-on gradient tape/flow (not just in training passes). This enables:

  * Token deposits into other cores outside a cluster region.
  * Movement/overlap across clusters without hardcoded routing.
  * Gradient-driven resource arbitration.

* **Special relativistic barrier.** As complexity approaches the allocated token limit, introduce a barrier curvature similar to relativistic asymptotics. Complexity cannot exceed capacity, but approaches it asymptotically. This barrier can itself be a **meta-learning structure**, adapting the curvature for different modules. It ensures stability near resource saturation and prevents catastrophic overload.

* **Higher-level unsupervised identification.** The architecture may classify sub-structures emergently, allocating special cluster-structures to sets of nodes. Inspired by physics datasets (e.g., high-energy electrons, photons, large mass objects):

  * Base state nodes manage low-energy/common patterns.
  * Higher-energy/outlier objects are assigned special clusters to avoid over-straining base structures.
  * This dynamic classification allows the graph space to manage rare or disruptive phenomena by structurally isolating them.

## Architectural Rules

1. **Hierarchy formation.** Start with level-0 cores; cap levels using `ceil(log2(n_0))`. Use **complexity gain per token (CGPT)** to decide when to **materialize** additional structure (e.g., elevate responsibilities, instantiate special clusters) or **consolidate back to identity** (hibernate/simplify) when contribution is low. No pruning or demotion: all components retain a persistent identity that can be repurposed later with minimal space cost.
2. **Nascent growth.** After a module converges under current capacity, spawn a nascent child/parent with identity mapping + sparse parameters. Allow grafting if CGPT improves.
3. **Persistent gradients.** Maintain differentiable paths for routing and token transfers. Never hardcode static partitions; prefer soft constraints with annealed sparsity.
4. **Complexity-landscape optimizers.** Augment loss with complexity terms; weight directions to reduce compute while preserving task loss.
5. **Relativistic barrier.** As a module’s effective complexity approaches its allocated token limit, apply a **special-relativistic barrier** that smoothly compresses step sizes (analogous to a Lorentz factor). Barrier curvature is meta-learned per module and per context.

## Token & Complexity Accounting

* **Tokens** are fungible compute quanta (time, FLOPs, memory slots).

* **Effective velocity** `v_eff` := `complexity / (token_limit + ε)` per module.

* **Inverse barrier (γ)** acts like a relativistic curvature factor:

  γ(C) = 1 / (scale \* sqrt(max(1 - (C/token\_limit)^2, ε)))

* **LC objective (multiplicative form):**

  L\_total(θ) = L\_task(θ) × γ(C(θ))

  The standard task loss is directly reshaped by the inverse barrier. At low complexity, γ≈constant and the effect is negligible. As complexity approaches its budget, γ grows sharply, distorting the loss surface and damping feasible updates. Backpropagation automatically carries derivatives through both L and C.

* **Complexity metrics** (module and sub-module) are tracked online; used in `distribute_tokens()` to allocate budget.

* **Budget law (sketch):** Allocate proportional to moving-average marginal improvement per complexity, but barrier curvature discourages chronic saturation.

## Unsupervised Structural Discovery & Special Clusters

* A **structure discovery** process scans graphs for high-level patterns without supervision (e.g., density/routing motifs, high-energy events).
* Sub-structures can be **classified** and **assigned a special cluster-structure** (custom routing, higher token ceilings, resilient connectors).
* Inspired by physics “special objects” (e.g., high-energy electrons/photons, massive composites): rare/high-energy patterns are elevated to special clusters to avoid overloading base state nodes.
* The “space” (graph topology + constraints) is **self-managing**: it can adapt local geometry, spawn nascent sub/sup-modules, and reallocate tokens when outliers would otherwise break base layers.

## Component Responsibilities

* **Sparse NN module:** Define `Core.sparse_nn` API, masking mechanics, persistent-gradient hooks.
* **Complexity estimator:** Implement `compute_complexity()` and rolling CGPT.
* **Optimizers:** Prototype complexity-aware variants (e.g., trust region + L0/L1 sparsity and routing penalties).
* **Routing/Connector:** Typed message passing; token deposit/withdraw protocols.
* **Hierarchy manager:** Level creation/merging under the `ceil(log2(n_0))` bound; **materialization/consolidation criteria**.
* **MetaMemory (per-module):** Maintain local summaries (sorted spectra, gradients, activations) with learnable temporal windows.

## Canonical Sorted Spectra (Control Feature)

**Goal:** Provide a uniform, comparable perspective on parameters for meta-learning without hard-coded importance assumptions.

* **Two-level sorting** per layer:

  1. **Within-neuron sort** of weights by signed value: largest positive → … → 0 → … → most negative.
  2. **Across-neuron order** by a canonical size metric (default: L2 norm of each neuron’s weight vector; alternatives: L1, spectral for matrices).
* **Usage:** Only during learning. Store compact summaries (quantiles, top-k signatures, stability indices). Inference uses raw tensors.
* **Stability:** Sorting becomes more reliable as training stabilizes; early noise tolerated via EMAs.
* **Initialization control:** Prefer a **finite, unstructured palette** (e.g., orthogonal/quasi-random seeds) so early sorted views are comparable across modules.
* **Cost control:** Use sampling + top-k + quantiles to avoid full sorts every step.

### Minimal APIs

```python
class SortedSpectrum:
    def compute(self, W: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:  # returns flattened, signed-sorted view
        flat = W.flatten().detach()
        vals, _ = torch.sort(flat, descending=True)
        return vals

class LayerCanonicalOrder:
    def neuron_score(self, W: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:  # per-neuron L2
        # assume W shape [out, in]
        return W.pow(2).sum(dim=1).sqrt()

    def order_neurons(self, W: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        scores = self.neuron_score(W)
        _, idx = torch.sort(scores, descending=True)
        return idx
```

## Relativistic Barrier (Details)

* **Form:** start with `γ(v) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 + ε)`; explore alternatives (softplus-based, logistic squashing) and let meta-learner choose.
* **Placement:** apply γ to (a) optimizer step size, (b) routing probabilities, (c) token deposit rates across connectors.
* **Credit assignment:** record γ-augmented traces to attribute when saturation avoidance improved task + complexity tradeoff.

## Unsupervised Discovery (Details)

* **Signals:** rarity scores (tail probabilities), energy metrics (activation norms, gradient magnitudes), and routing entropy.
* **Mechanics:** spectral/graph clustering + contrastive prototypes; **materialize** clusters to `special_cluster_type` when impact > threshold.
* **Safety:** cap special-cluster proliferation; **consolidate to identity/hibernate** if CGPT contribution declines, preserving reuse without deletion.

## Gradient-based Novelty Signaling & Transient Structures

**Goal:** let modules express capacity distress/novelty and trigger learned structural responses—without manual control flow.

### Signals (emitted by base/specialized modules)

* `grad_energy` := EMA(||g||), `grad_var` := Var(g) over recent batches
* `residual_error` or output entropy/dispersion
* `v_eff`, `γ` from the relativistic barrier
* `routing_entropy` (instability of paths), `saturation_time` (fraction of steps with γ above a threshold)

### Learned reactions (by sup/meta modules)

* **Transient structure instantiation:** spawn short-lived capacity near the affected region; parameters initialized from cached prototypes.
* **Token & route reallocation:** continuous deltas (no if/else); γ-aware damping prevents thrash.
* **Lifecycle:** if a transient repeatedly activates and improves the Lagrangian, **materialize** it as a persistent special cluster; if its marginal benefit falls, **consolidate back to identity** (hibernate). No pruning.

### Caching & reuse

* Maintain a sparse **prototype cache** keyed by signal signatures (hash of normalized feature vector). Recurrent conditions (e.g., moving black hole) reuse prior structure with minimal retraining.

### Minimal Interfaces

```python
class NoveltySignal:
    def __init__(self, grad_energy, grad_var, residual, v_eff, gamma, routing_entropy, saturation_time):
        self.vec = torch.tensor([grad_energy, grad_var, residual, v_eff, gamma, routing_entropy, saturation_time])

class TransientFactory:
    def propose(self, signal: NoveltySignal, neighborhood):
        # returns differentiable proposals: Δtokens, Δroutes, init_params (from cache or nascent template)
        pass

class PrototypeCache:
    def lookup(self, signature):
        # returns prior params if a similar condition was seen; else None
        pass
```

### Training

* All proposals are trained end-to-end under the global Lagrangian; thresholds (if any) are soft/learned.
* Persistent gradient summaries provide the time context for distinguishing one-off spikes vs sustained regime change.

## Open Questions / TODOs

* Do we need `error_curve` as a meta-proposer or can CGPT suffice?
* Best practice for persistent gradient without prohibitive memory: checkpointing + low-rank surrogates?
* Formalize token market dynamics (auctions vs proportional control).
* Define meta-learning policies for relativistic barrier curvature.
* Determine criteria for emergent sub-structure specialization.

## Notes (from proposal text)

```
initial heirarchy bounds could be set using the maximum number of levels if minimal cluster size of two is assumed per level
    ceil(log_2(n_level_0_cores))
after completing initial optimization, a nascent_sub_module could be generated
    nascent being an identity structure but with sparse learning abilities
perhaps even a nascent_sup_module

persistent gradient structure
    not just for training
    keeping an active gradient creates the ability to do things like deposit tokens into other cores outside a cluster region
    this gives the architecture the flexbility to have movement and overlap without hardcoding
```

## State of This Conversation (decisions & open threads)

### Agreed Decisions

1. **Lifecycle language:** use *materialize* (instantiate/persist additional structure) and *consolidate to identity* (hibernate/simplify). No pruning/demotion; all components keep a persistent identity for future reuse.
2. **Relativistic inverse barrier:** adopt the *inverse* barrier (special-relativity style) with hard clipping at the token budget, small ε floor for stability. Effects are negligible far from the limit and strong near capacity.
3. **LC objective (multiplicative):** adopt `L_total(θ) = L_task(θ) × γ(C(θ))` so the barrier reshapes the loss directly; backprop naturally carries derivatives through both `L` and `C`.
4. **Implicit control flow via signaling:** no if/else rules; modules emit learned signals (grad energy/variance, residuals, γ, routing entropy), and higher-level structures learn to respond.
5. **Canonical sorting for control:** within-neuron signed sorting + across-neuron norm order as a uniform viewpoint; used only during learning (with EMAs); initialization via a finite, unstructured palette.

### Clarified Concepts

* **CGPT (marginal efficiency):** conceptual tool to reason about materialize vs consolidate choices; overshadowed in practice by the multiplicative LC objective and inverse barrier.
* **Transient vs persistent:** repeated beneficial transients can *materialize*; otherwise they *consolidate to identity* (cache persists, capacity released).

### Open Items / Next Steps

* **Stochasticness canvas:** create/attach a dedicated canvas to formalize memory structures (multi-hypothesis, distributional heads, sampling caches) and how LC dynamics govern their growth.
* **Barrier curvature meta-learning:** decide which parameters of γ are learnable (scale, ε schedule) and where they live (per-module vs shared priors).
* **Experiment plan:** minimal synthetic benchmarks to visualize LC behavior, nascent activation, and consolidation under moving “black hole” conditions.
